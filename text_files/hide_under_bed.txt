You quickly hide under your bed. After some time
you hear slow footsteps that are approaching your
room. At the foot of the door appear a pair of
boots that are heading towards your bed and
suddenly stop. You stop breathing and close yours
eyes. Suddenly, you feel something grabbing you
and starting drag you from under the bed. You grab
one of the legs of the bed and hold onto it but
the intruder is too strong. He finally pulls you
out and smashes your head on the ground with his
boot.
