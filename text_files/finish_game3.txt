Having arrived at the park, you see a group of
kids near the base you all used when playing.
Everyone is talking quietly but quickly. One of
the kids sees you and tells something to the
others. Your friend Sam appears from behind two
taller kids and smiles.

'I thought you were a goner. You didn't pick up
when I called you so I thought the worst might
have happened!'

'I am fine, but what is actually going on?'

'We don't have much idea ourselves, to be honest.'
