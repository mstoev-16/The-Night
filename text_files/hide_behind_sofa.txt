You quickly hide behind the sofa and wait. After
some time, you hear quick footsteps and a loud
crash. The phone stops ringing. Then you hear the
footsteps near you and suddenly something grabs
you by the nape, lifts you up, and starts
squeezing. You start kicking the air but it serves
you no purpose. It's getting harder to breathe and
you feel like your neck is getting crushed.
