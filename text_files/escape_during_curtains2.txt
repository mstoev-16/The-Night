Then you hear a ring. The kitchen phone. The
intruder drops you and starts to twitch
frantically. He starts walking towards the kitchen
in a disoriented manner but trips on the coat
rack. The figure tries to get up a couple of times
but it is in vain and it finally collapses. You go
to the kitchen to call the police but as soon as
you enter the ringing stops. Then you see the keys
on the counter, you pick them up and go to the
front door while carefully going around the figure
which you try not to look at. You unlock the door
and leave.
