You try to breathe quietly and keep your
composure. The intruder is walking slowly towards
the closet. Just a few more steps and he will be
able to open the door. Suddenly, the figure stops.
You hear a noise coming from downstaris - the
kitchen phone is ringing. The figure shifts its
head towards the sound and sprints out of the
room. A few seconds later, you hear a crash coming
from downstairs and you no longer hear the
ringing.
