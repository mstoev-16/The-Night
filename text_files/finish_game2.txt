After a few minutes, you reach the park where you
see a small group of kids in their pijamas, among
which is your best friend Sam. He is holding a
cellphone up to his head and looks impatient.
The moment he sees you he lowers the phone and
smiles.

'Jesus! I was just calling you, hoping you didn't
end up like some of the others.', he says.

'What others? What is going on?', you ask.

'I don't know exactly, but I'll explain in a
moment what I know.'
