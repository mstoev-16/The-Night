You leave the room and make your way into the
storage-room. After closing the door you start
waiting. During that time you think of a way of
leaving the house. You rembember that last night
you locked the front door and left the keys in the
kitchen. A couple of minutes later, you hear some
footsteps going up the staircase. They dissappear
into the other end of the corridor. You quietly
open the door and go to the kitchen. There you see
the keys on the counter, you pick them up and
unlock the front door.
