The best thing to do is call the police. You
enter the kitchen and head towards the phone on
the counter. You dial 911, but no one answers.
Just as you are putting the phone it rings back
and the line automatically picks up.

'Hello?', you ask quietly as you are putting the
phone to your ear. 

"It's Sam! Leave the house now! Meet us at the 
park! Don't make me explain!"

The other line hangs up and after it you do too.
