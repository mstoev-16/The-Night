The intruder will definietly not expect from you
to sneak into the living room so he won't be
alert. You get out of the room and head towards
the staircase. As you are carefully going down
you successfully reach the final step. You turn
towards the living-room but there you see the
shadowy figure looking right at you. Before you
even move, he has already put you to the ground
and started choking you with his strong hands.
