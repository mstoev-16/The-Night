After what feels like an eternity, the intruder
goes upstairs. You leave your hideout. You now
remember leaving your keys on the kitchen counter
so you take them, unlock the front door and leave
the house. You head towards the base in the park
because this is the location where kids keep a
stash of emergency items.
