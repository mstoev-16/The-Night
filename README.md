# The Night - A text-based game

Making a text-based game was something I always wanted to try and the *The Night* is my humble attempt. The story itself is quite simple. In this game you are a kid who tries to escape from his house in which there is a dangerous intruder. There are 5 possible endings to this relatively short project.


## How to start and play the game
**(This is intended for Windows users as I am not aware how it works on other operating systems.)**

- To start the project, you need to download the files in a folder of your choice. Afterwards, open the that said folder and on the address bar type 'cmd'. The *Command prompt* should open where you enter the following command - *'python the_night.py'*. Now the game is ready to be played.

- You will be prompted to make choices by typing numbers or letters. Keep in mind that this game is not really error-proofed so any wrong input will result in an error.

- In some cases, the game will prompt you to continue the game by typing the letter 'c'. If you enter something different, the same message will be prompted again until the correct letter is entered.
